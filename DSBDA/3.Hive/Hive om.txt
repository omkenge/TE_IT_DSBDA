What is Hive?
Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure tool to process structured data in Hadoop. It
resides on top of Hadoop to summarize Big Data, and makes querying and analyzing
easy. Initially Hive was developed by Facebook, later the Apache Software Foundation took
it up and developed it further as an open source under the name Apache Hive. It is
used by different companies. For example, Amazon uses it in Amazon Elastic
MapReduce. Hive is not
● A relational database
● A design for OnLine Transaction Processing (OLTP)
● A language for real-time queries and row-level updates
Features of Hive
● It stores schema in a database and processed data
Hive Query Language (HiveQL) is a query language in Apache Hive for processing
and analyzing structured data. It separates users from the complexity of Map Reduce
programming. It reuses common concepts from relational databases, such as tables, rows, columns, and schema, to ease learning. Hive provides a CLI for Hive query
writing using Hive Query Language (HiveQL). HiveQL Built-in Operators
